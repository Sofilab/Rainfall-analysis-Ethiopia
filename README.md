# Africa Rainfall Analysis

This project explores rainfall data across five African countries: **Ethiopia**, **Kenya**, **Malawi**, **Benin**, and **CÃ´te d'Ivoire**. Using Python and data science tools, the goal is to analyze seasonal patterns, detect climate variability, and support climate-resilient infrastructure development.

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw rainfall data
- Analyze spatial and temporal rainfall patterns
- Visualize trends and anomalies
- Share reproducible insights for use in environmental planning, agriculture, and engineering

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for version control
- Visual Studio Code (optional)

## Data Source

Rainfall datasets obtained from national and regional repositories.  
Manual data entry and cleaning were performed for consistency.
